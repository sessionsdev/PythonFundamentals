From the previous example, move your calculation of
how many seconds in a year to a python executable script.

'''

days_in_year = 365
hours_in_day = 24
minutes_in_hours = 60
seconds_in_minutes = 60

seconds_in_year = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hours * seconds_in_minutes
print(seconds_in_year)
